            <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969, the son of journalists Anna and Nils
                Torvalds,[7] the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson
                of journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki
                in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. He was named after Linus
                Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open
                Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon
                character", noting that this made him "half Nobel Prize–winning chemist and half blanket-carrying
                cartoon character".[8]</p>
